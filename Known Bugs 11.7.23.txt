Movement bugs:
- collision detection with walls is not exact and allows the character to push into the wall

Ladder bugs:
- when horizontal input is first pressed then vertical is pressed the horizonal input can be spammed when climbing the ladder to constantly
	detach and re-attach
	(Solution) ladder grab cooldown.
- When descending the ladder the player will go into the ground and teleports back
